# Twitch_social_network
Created on 2022 4/20 for the course Network Science. Aim of this is to write a paper about a Twitch social networks dataset

# About the project

The flair of mature content can be chosen by each user, but for being a Twitch Affiliate, specific requirements need to be satisfied:
- at least 500 total minutes broadcast in the last 30 days;
- at least seven unique broadcast days in the previous 30 days;
- an average of 3 concurrent viewers or more in the previous 30 days;
- and at least 50 followers.

However, not everybody who have these conditions met is not an affiliate of twitch.
